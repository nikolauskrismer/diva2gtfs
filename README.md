# DIVA2GTFS


This is an experimental suite used to import DIVA data structures and parse it into GTFS. It is currently neither well designed nor particularly user-friendly, but it gets the job done, somehow.

## Prerequisites

I recommend running the scripts in a GNU/Linux environment. It might be possible to use this suite in MS-Windows, but I would not know how to perform the necessary coordinate transformations :(

You will need:
 * perl(1)
 * proj(1) (for the cs2cs coordinate transformation tool)
 * sqlite3 (1) (or another database of your choice)

```
$ apt-get install perl proj sqlite3
```

Additionally, the following Perl modules are necessary:
 * DBI
 * Getopt::Long
 * DateTime
 * Date::Holidays::DE (for taking care of German holidays)
 * DateTime::Format::Strptime

```
$ perl -MCPAN -e shell
cpan[n]> install DBI
cpan[n]> install DateTime
cpan[n]> install Date::Holidays::DE
cpan[n]> install DateTime::Format::Strptime
```

If you do not have installation privileges on your machine, you might want to use local::lib. 
<http://jjnapiorkowski.typepad.com/modern-perl/2010/02/bootstrapping-locallib.html> describes a one-step-solution how to do it; the necessary script can be found at <https://github.com/jjn1056/bootstrap-locallib.pl>

## Usage 

### Step 1: Setting up the databases

initdb will take care of setting up the sqlite databases. Just run
```
./initdb.pl --create all
```
to create both DIVA and GTFS databases: divadata.db and diva2gtfs.db

initdb supports the following options:
```
--create <option> # creates tables, if not already existing
--drop <option>   # drops tables if existing
--clear <option>  # drops tables and rebuild them
```

Options:
 * divaservice -- DIVA tables concerning service restrictions
 * divalnrlit -- DIVA tables pointing to route definition files
 * divastops -- DIVA stop definition
 * diva -- _all_ of the DIVA tables
 * gtfsstops -- GTFS stop table
 * gtfsruns -- GTFS trips, routes and stop_times tables
 * gtfscalendar -- GTFS calendar and calendar_dates tables
 * gtfs -- _all_ GTFS tables (includes tables not accessed by the gtfs options above)

### Step 2: Load DIVA data into database

loaddiva.pl will stupidly parse any DIVA file you give it as a command-line argument, parse it for tabular content and insert it into the pre-defined DIVA database. If a table is not defined, this will fail spectacularly.

Please provide loaddiva with all stop definition (haltestellen.\* but _not_ haltestellen.format32.\*), service restriction (vbesch.\*), agencies descriptions (bzw), guaranteed transfers (anschlb.\*) and route tables (lnrlit) and let it churn through them.

### Step 3: Convert DIVA tables to GTFS
```
./stops2gtfs.pl
./service2gtfs.pl
```

Both scripts will go through the DIVA tables and transform their content into GTFS format. For the coordinate transformation, cs2cs from proj(1) is needed. Currently, only GK3 coordinates (plan = NBWT in the DIVA tables) will be converted. This has to be fixed. Sometimes. By someone. Someoneâ„¢. Get the pull requests flowing.

### Step 4: Load route files

After everything has been prepared, the magic can happen. Call 
```
./diva2gtfs.pl --path /path/to/diva/basedirectory/
```

If the lnrlit table was correctly populated, everything should happen automagically. Or not. I am lacking test cases, so far.

### Step 5: Fine-tuning the data

Optionally, you can now use the guaranteed transfers data out of the DIVA anschlb table and update your trips table:
```
./transfers2gtfs.pl
```

Also, you might want to import Shapes from your friendly EFA. This is possible through ./efaShapeExporter.pl, which is currently hardcoded to the DING EFA. Messy coding, again, sorry.

### Finally: Output GTFS data

Run the following commands:

```
sqlite3 -header -csv diva2gtfs.db "select * from stops AS s where s.stop_id in (select distinct parent_station from stops AS st where location_type = 0 and st.stop_id in (select distinct stop_id from stop_times)) UNION select * from stops where stop_id in (select distinct stop_id from stop_times);" > stops.txt
sqlite3 -header -csv diva2gtfs.db "select * from calendar where service_id in (select distinct service_id from trips);" > calendar.txt
sqlite3 -header -csv diva2gtfs.db "select * from calendar_dates where service_id in (select distinct service_id from trips);" > calendar_dates.txt
sqlite3 -header -csv diva2gtfs.db "select * from trips;" > trips.txt
sqlite3 -header -csv diva2gtfs.db "select * from routes;" > routes.txt
sqlite3 -header -csv diva2gtfs.db "select * from stop_times;" > stop_times.txt
``
